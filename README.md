# Sorting_Tests
A quick python script to test the runtime of bubble sort, heap sort, merge sort, insertion sort, and binary insertion sort on Windows computers.

This script will run each sort with n random integers in an array 5 times and take the lowest of those times to reduce the effect of system noise.
